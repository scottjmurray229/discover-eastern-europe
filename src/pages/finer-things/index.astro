        <p>Eastern Europe redefined luxury travel for me. A Michelin-starred tasting menu in Budapest costs what an appetizer does in Paris. VIP opera seats in Prague are cheaper than nosebleeds in London. And the thermal baths in Budapest? There's nothing like floating in 38-degree mineral water inside a building that's been standing since the Ottoman Empire. The quality is world-class. The prices are still catching up.

        <h2 class="ft-protips-heading">Scott's Pro Tips</h2>
        <div class="scott-tips">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Book Restaurants Early:</strong> Michelin-starred restaurants in Prague and Budapest book out 2&ndash;3 weeks ahead, especially on weekends. Lunch tasting menus are often 30&ndash;40% cheaper than dinner with the same kitchen quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Thermal Bath Strategy:</strong> Gellert and Szechenyi are busiest 11am&ndash;3pm on weekends. Go before 9am or after 5pm for a fraction of the crowd. Bring your own towel and flip-flops to avoid rental fees.</li>
            <li><strong>Opera Hack:</strong> Budapest and Prague opera tickets can be purchased day-of at the box office for significant discounts. Dress code is relaxed compared to Vienna &mdash; smart casual is fine. Box seats often cost less than orchestra in Western Europe.</li>
            <li><strong>Wine Regions by Car:</strong> Tokaj, Goriska Brda, and South Moravia are all best explored with a rental car or private driver. Public transport exists but limits you to one or two cellars. A private driver for the day runs &euro;100&ndash;150 &mdash; split with another couple and it's a bargain.</li>
            <li><strong>Shoulder Season:</strong> April&ndash;May and September&ndash;October deliver the best luxury value. Hotels drop 30&ndash;50% from summer peaks, restaurants are easier to book, and the weather is ideal for walking tours.</li>
            <li><strong>Currency Tips:</strong> Always pay in local currency (CZK, HUF, HRK, EUR depending on country). The "pay in your home currency" option at restaurants and hotels always includes a 3&ndash;7% markup. Carry euros as a backup &mdash; widely accepted in Slovenia, Croatia, and the Baltics.</li>

          <summary class="ft-faq-question">Is Eastern Europe actually luxury-level quality?</summary>
          <p class="ft-faq-answer">Absolutely. Budapest has more Michelin-starred restaurants than many Western European capitals. Prague's hotel scene rivals any city in Europe. The difference is price &mdash; you get Western quality at 40&ndash;60% of the cost. The thermal bath culture in Budapest is world-class and has been for centuries.</p>

        <details class="ft-faq-item">
          <summary class="ft-faq-question">What's the best city for a luxury long weekend?</summary>
          <p class="ft-faq-answer">Budapest is the clear winner for a 3&ndash;4 day luxury trip. You get world-class dining, thermal baths, opera, river views, and boutique hotels in a compact, walkable city. Prague is a close second, and combining the two with a 2.5-hour train ride is the ultimate Central European luxury itinerary.</p>

          <summary class="ft-faq-question">Do I need to dress up for opera and fine dining?</summary>
          <p class="ft-faq-answer">Smart casual is the baseline for both. Men should have a collared shirt and closed-toe shoes; women, a nice top and dress shoes. Black tie is not expected outside of gala nights. Michelin restaurants in Prague and Budapest are less formal than their Paris or London equivalents.</p>

          <summary class="ft-faq-question">When is the best time to visit for luxury travel?</summary>
          <p class="ft-faq-answer">September and October offer the perfect combination: mild weather, harvest season wine events, start of the opera and ballet season, and hotel prices 30&ndash;40% below summer peaks. May is equally excellent before the summer crowds arrive.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="ft-faq-item">
          <summary class="ft-faq-question">Are Danube river cruises worth the price?</summary>
          <p class="ft-faq-answer">For the right traveler, yes. A 7-night Budapest-to-Amsterdam cruise with Viking or Uniworld is all-inclusive and covers four countries without unpacking twice. The value is in the convenience and the onboard experience. If you prefer independence, the same cities are easily connected by train for a fraction of the cost.</p>
