Always pay in the local currency — never accept "dynamic currency conversion" at ATMs or shops.' },
      { label: 'ATM Strategy', text: 'Use bank-owned ATMs (Euronet ATMs charge huge fees — avoid them). Withdraw in local currency, decline the conversion offer, and let your own bank handle the exchange. Wise (TransferWise) and Revolut debit cards give excellent rates with minimal fees. Notify your bank before traveling.' },
      { label: 'Cards vs Cash', text: 'Cards are widely accepted in major cities, especially in the Baltics and Czech Republic. Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Serbia are more cash-dependent — smaller restaurants, markets, and transport often require cash. Always carry €50-100 equivalent in local currency.' },

Book via national rail sites (cd.cz, mav-start.hu, pkp.pl) or Omio/Trainline for the best prices.' },
      { label: 'Budget Airlines', text: 'Ryanair, Wizz Air, and easyJet connect most Eastern European cities for €15-60 one way if booked early. Wizz Air is especially strong in the region. Always check baggage rules — cabin bag only keeps costs lowest.' },

Use a crossbody bag, keep valuables in front pockets, and use hotel safes.' },

In Romania, Bulgaria, and Serbia, stick to bottled water or use a filter — tap water is generally safe in major cities but quality varies.' },

Be wary of anyone who approaches you unsolicited in tourist areas.' },

In Czech pubs, the waiter marks your tab on a paper slip — don\'t lose it. In Hungary, don\'t clink beer glasses (a historical tradition). Always say "na zdravi" / "egeszsegedre" / "na zdrowie" when toasting.' },
      { label: 'Dress & Behavior', text: 'Eastern Europeans dress more formally than Americans — smart casual works everywhere. Cover shoulders and knees in churches and mosques. Remove shoes when entering someone\'s home (hosts usually offer slippers). Public drunkenness is frowned upon even in party cities like Prague and Budapest.' },

    { question: "Do I need a visa to visit Eastern Europe?", answer: "US, UK, Canadian, and Australian passport holders can enter all EU/Schengen countries visa-free for up to 90 days within any 180-day period. Serbia allows 90 days separately. No visa application needed — just show up with a valid passport. The EU's ETIAS pre-travel authorization (similar to US ESTA) is expected to launch in 2026." },
    { question: "Is Eastern Europe safe for tourists?", answer: "Eastern Europe is very safe for tourists. Most countries have lower violent crime rates than Western Europe or the US. Petty theft (pickpocketing) in crowded tourist areas of Prague, Budapest, and Barcelona-level cities is the main risk. Use common sense, keep valuables secure, and use ride-hailing apps for taxis. Solo female travelers regularly report feeling safe across the region." },
    { question: "How much does it cost to travel Eastern Europe?", answer: "Eastern Europe is significantly cheaper than Western Europe. Budget travelers can manage on €15-30/day (hostels, street food, public transport). Mid-range travelers spend €50-100/day (hotels, restaurants, activities). The cheapest destinations are Sofia, Belgrade, and Bucharest. The most expensive are Prague, Dubrovnik, and Tallinn — though still cheaper than Paris or London." },
    { question: "What is the best way to get around Eastern Europe?", answer: "Trains connect most capitals efficiently: Prague-Budapest (7h), Budapest-Bratislava (2.5h), Vilnius-Riga (4h). FlixBus covers routes trains don't. Budget airlines (Wizz Air, Ryanair) fly between cities for €15-60. Within cities, metro/tram systems are excellent and cheap (€1-2 per ride). Bolt/Uber work across the region for ride-hailing." },
    { question: "What currencies do I need?", answer: "Six of our 13 destinations use the euro (Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Croatia). The rest use local currencies. A travel card like Wise or Revolut handles all conversions automatically at great rates. Never change money at airport kiosks or accept 'dynamic currency conversion' — always pay in local currency and let your bank convert." },
    { question: "What is the best time to visit Eastern Europe?", answer: "May-June and September are ideal — warm weather, fewer crowds, and lower prices than peak summer. July-August is peak season with the highest prices, especially in Dubrovnik and coastal Croatia. Winter (December-February) is cold but magical for Christmas markets in Prague, Budapest, and Tallinn. Shoulder seasons offer the best balance of weather, crowds, and cost." },
