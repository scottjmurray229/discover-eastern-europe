  <!-- FAQ -->
  <FAQ items={[
    { question: "What are the most important historical sites in Eastern Europe?", answer: "Auschwitz-Birkenau near Krakow is the most visited and most important memorial site. Prague Castle is the largest ancient castle complex in the world. Budapest's House of Terror documents both Nazi and Soviet atrocities. Dubrovnik's Old Town walls tell stories from medieval trade to the 1990s siege. Tallinn's medieval Old Town is among Europe's best-preserved." },
    { question: "How did the Iron Curtain affect Eastern Europe?", answer: "From 1945 to 1989, Soviet-backed communist governments controlled most of Eastern Europe. Citizens faced travel restrictions, state surveillance, censorship, and economic central planning. The effects are still visible: Soviet-era apartment blocks, Cold War museums, and a generational divide between those who lived through communism and those born after. Understanding this period is essential context for travel in the region." },
    { question: "What happened in 1989?", answer: "In a remarkable chain of events, communist regimes fell across Eastern Europe within months. Hungary opened its border with Austria (May), Poland held semi-free elections (June), the Berlin Wall fell (November), Czechoslovakia had its Velvet Revolution (November), and Romania overthrew Ceausescu (December). The Baltic states had already begun their 'Singing Revolution' in 1988. By 1991, all had achieved independence or democratic governance." },
    { question: "Is it appropriate to visit Holocaust sites as a tourist?", answer: "Yes — visiting sites like Auschwitz-Birkenau is an important act of remembrance and education. Be respectful: dress modestly, don't take selfies at memorials, keep your voice low, and take time to read the exhibits. Book a guided tour for context. The Auschwitz Museum recommends a minimum 3.5-hour visit. Other important Holocaust sites include Budapest's Shoes on the Danube and Vilnius's Paneriai memorial." },
    { question: "How did the Ottoman Empire influence the Balkans?", answer: "The Ottoman Empire ruled much of the Balkans for 400-500 years, leaving deep cultural marks. Ottoman influence is visible in cuisine (burek, cevapi, Turkish coffee), architecture (mosques, hammams, bazaars), and daily customs. Sofia, Belgrade, and Bucharest all have Ottoman-era structures. The blend of Ottoman, Habsburg, and Slavic traditions creates the cultural richness that makes the Balkans so fascinating to explore." },
