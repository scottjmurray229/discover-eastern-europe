  - { question: "Should I visit Auschwitz from Krakow?", answer: "Yes, but approach it with respect and proper planning. Auschwitz-Birkenau is about 70km west of Krakow. Book a guided tour or take a bus from the main station (about 1.5 hours). Allow a full day. The experience is heavy and profoundly important.

  - { question: "How does Krakow compare to Warsaw?", answer: "Krakow is more compact, more walkable, and better preserved — it survived World War II largely intact while Warsaw was almost completely destroyed. Krakow is the better choice for first-time visitors to Poland. Warsaw has its own appeal as a modern, rebuilt capital, but Krakow delivers the historic atmosphere most travellers are looking for." }

Krakow is the city that makes you reconsider your assumptions about Poland. I arrived expecting a post-Soviet grey cityscape, and instead I found one of the most beautiful, vibrant, and affordable cities in all of Europe. The Main Square alone — the largest medieval market square on the continent — would be enough to justify a visit. But Krakow layers so much more on top of that: a hilltop castle, a bohemian Jewish quarter reborn as a creative hub, salt mines that feel like entering another world, and some of the most generous and welcoming people I have encountered anywhere.

## The Historic Core

### Main Market Square (Rynek Glowny)

The Rynek is massive — roughly 200 metres on each side — and it has been the beating heart of Krakow since the 13th century. The Cloth Hall sits in the centre, a Renaissance trading hall that still functions as a market on the ground floor (tourist souvenirs, mostly, but the architecture above is the real draw). St. Mary's Basilica anchors one corner, its twin towers asymmetrical and iconic. Every hour, a trumpeter plays the Hejnal from the taller tower, cutting off mid-phrase to commemorate a 13th-century watchman supposedly shot by a Mongol arrow. The story may be legend, but the tradition is real and oddly moving.

I spent mornings sitting in the Rynek with coffee, watching the square wake up — horse-drawn carriages lining up, flower sellers arranging their stalls, pigeons doing their pigeon things. It is one of those rare public spaces that works at every hour.

### Wawel Castle

The castle complex sits on a limestone hill above the Vistula River, and it is where Polish kings ruled for centuries. The Gothic cathedral inside houses royal tombs, including those of the legendary King Casimir the Great. The castle interiors — particularly the State Rooms with their Renaissance ceiling carvings — are worth the separate admission ticket. The grounds are free to enter and offer excellent views of the river and the city below. I recommend walking up from the Old Town via the gentle slope on the south side rather than the main tourist entrance, which gets congested.

### Kazimierz

The former Jewish Quarter of Kazimierz is one of my favourite neighbourhoods in any European city. Once home to a thriving Jewish community that was devastated during the Holocaust, Kazimierz spent decades in decline before undergoing a remarkable revival starting in the 1990s. Today it is Krakow's cultural and nightlife centre — a dense collection of independent bars, cafes, galleries, vintage shops, and restaurants packed into narrow streets.

Plac Nowy, the neighbourhood's central square, hosts a daily food market. The zapiekanka — an open-faced baguette topped with mushrooms, cheese, and various extras — is Kazimierz's signature street food. The versions from the vendors inside the circular Okraglak hall have been feeding locals and visitors for decades.

The Jewish heritage sites remain profoundly important. The Old Synagogue, Remuh Synagogue and cemetery, and several other synagogues are open to visitors. The Galicia Jewish Museum offers thoughtful exhibitions on Jewish life in the region. Walking through Kazimierz, you feel both the weight of what was lost and the vitality of what has grown since.

## Day Trips That Define the Experience

### Auschwitz-Birkenau

I hesitate to call this a "day trip" because it is not an excursion — it is a pilgrimage. The former Nazi concentration and extermination camp is about 70 kilometres west of Krakow, and visiting it is one of the most important things you can do while in Poland. Guided tours take about three and a half hours covering both Auschwitz I and Birkenau. Book timed entry well in advance through the official museum website. Buses from Krakow's main bus station run frequently and take about 90 minutes.

I went early in the morning on a weekday in September. Even with moderate crowds, the silence inside the barracks was overwhelming. Give yourself the full day and do not plan anything else afterward. You will need the evening to process.

### Wieliczka Salt Mine

If Auschwitz is the heavy day, Wieliczka is the wonder. This UNESCO-listed salt mine, operational since the 13th century, descends 135 metres underground through a maze of chambers, chapels, and sculptures — all carved from salt. The Chapel of St. Kinga, an underground cathedral with chandeliers made of salt crystals, is genuinely jaw-dropping. The guided tour takes about two hours and covers roughly two kilometres of tunnels. It is one of those experiences that sounds touristy but completely delivers.

The mine is 15 kilometres southeast of Krakow, reachable by local bus or train in about 30 minutes. Book tickets online to skip the queue.

## Food and Drink

Polish food is hearty, generous, and perfect for cold weather. Pierogi — dumplings stuffed with potato and cheese, meat, or sauerkraut — are the national staple. A plate of a dozen at a milk bar (bar mleczny) runs about €3-4. These cafeteria-style restaurants from the communist era serve simple, cheap, home-style food and remain some of the best value meals in Europe. Beyond pierogi, look for zurek (sour rye soup in a bread bowl), bigos (hunter's stew), and oscypek (grilled smoked sheep's cheese with cranberry sauce).

## Getting Around

Krakow's historic centre is compact and best explored on foot. The Old Town, Wawel Castle, and Kazimierz are all within easy walking distance. Trams and buses cover the wider city, and a single ticket costs about €1. The train and bus stations sit adjacent near the Old Town, making day trip departures easy.

## When to Visit

May through June and September through October offer the best conditions. July and August bring peak crowds and higher prices. Winter has genuine appeal: Krakow's Christmas market in the Main Square is one of the best in Europe.

### Scott's Tips for Krakow

1. **Eat at a milk bar (bar mleczny) at least once.** These communist-era cafeterias serve filling, home-cooked Polish food at absurdly low prices. Kuchnia u Doroty near the Old Town is a solid choice. Point at what looks good, pay a few euros, and eat like a local.

2. **Book Auschwitz tickets the moment you confirm your trip.** Free timed-entry slots, especially for English-language guided tours, sell out weeks in advance during summer. The museum website is the only legitimate booking source. Do not buy from third-party resellers charging inflated prices.

3. **Explore Kazimierz at night.** The neighbourhood transforms after dark. Alchemia bar has been the anchor of the scene for years — dim lighting, candlelit tables, live music in the basement. Wander from there and you will find your own favourite spot within a block or two.

4. **Climb St. Mary's tower for the best view of the Rynek.** The 239-step climb is narrow and winding, but the view from the top puts the full scale of the Main Square into perspective. Limited entry means small groups, so it never feels crowded up there.

5. **Take the free Wawel Castle grounds walk in the evening.** The castle interiors close by late afternoon, but the grounds stay open later. The views over the Vistula at dusk are beautiful, the crowds thin out, and the floodlit cathedral is atmospheric in a way the daytime visit cannot match.
