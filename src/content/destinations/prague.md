Prague grabbed me the moment I stepped off the tram and saw the Vltava River glinting under a line of Gothic spires. There is something about this city that feels frozen in a fairy tale — except the beer is cheap, the food is hearty, and the streets are alive with a creative energy that no storybook could capture. I have visited dozens of European capitals, and Prague consistently ranks among the ones I tell people to visit first if they have never been to this part of the world.

## Why Prague Belongs on Your List

The Czech capital survived both World Wars largely intact, which means the architecture you see today is genuinely centuries old — not a reconstruction. Walking from Old Town Square through Mala Strana and up to Prague Castle, you pass through Romanesque, Gothic, Baroque, and Art Nouveau in a single afternoon. That layered history gives Prague a density of beauty that few cities can match.

Then there is the cost. Prague is no longer the ultra-cheap destination it was in the 1990s, but it remains remarkably affordable compared to Paris, London, or Amsterdam. A half-litre of excellent Czech lager still costs under €2 in most neighbourhood pubs. A full lunch at a local restaurant rarely exceeds €8. You can have a genuinely luxurious trip here for what would be a mid-range budget in Western Europe.

## The Must-See Landmarks

### Charles Bridge

The 14th-century stone bridge lined with Baroque statues is Prague's signature image, and it earns every bit of the hype. My advice: set an alarm and get there at sunrise. By mid-morning, the bridge is shoulder-to-shoulder with tourists and vendors. At dawn, you get the bridge, the river mist, and the castle silhouette practically to yourself. I have done this three times now, and each time the light was different and equally stunning.

### Prague Castle

The castle complex is enormous — the Guinness Book lists it as the largest ancient castle in the world. Inside, you will find St. Vitus Cathedral with its spectacular stained glass, the Old Royal Palace, Golden Lane with its tiny colourful houses, and several gardens with panoramic views over the red rooftops below. Budget at least half a day. I recommend the Circuit B ticket, which covers the main highlights without the fatigue of trying to see everything.

### Old Town Square and the Astronomical Clock

The medieval Astronomical Clock draws a crowd every hour on the hour when its mechanical figures perform their brief show. Honestly, the show itself is underwhelming — a few figures rotate, a rooster crows, and it is over in about 30 seconds. But the clock face itself is a masterpiece of medieval engineering, and Old Town Square is one of the most beautiful urban spaces in Europe. Grab a spot at one of the cafes, order a coffee, and just absorb the scene.

### Beer Culture

The Czech Republic drinks more beer per capita than any country on Earth, and it is not even close. Czech lager — the original Pilsner style — was born here, and the brewing tradition runs deep. Skip the tourist pubs on the main squares and find a neighbourhood hospoda (pub). I spent an entire evening at a place in Zizkov where a half-litre of tank beer cost €1.30, the regulars were watching football, and the atmosphere was completely unpretentious. That is Prague beer culture at its best.

## Neighbourhoods Worth Exploring

### Vinohrady

This residential district south of the centre is where young professionals and expats live, and the food and cafe scene reflects it. Peaceful tree-lined streets, excellent brunch spots, wine bars, and a park with a hilltop pavilion offering one of the best views in the city. If I were living in Prague, this is where I would settle.

### Zizkov

Rougher around the edges than Vinohrady, Zizkov is packed with dive bars, craft beer spots, and a bohemian attitude. The Zizkov Television Tower — love it or hate it — dominates the skyline with its bizarre crawling baby sculptures. Climb to the top for a panoramic view that rivals the castle.

### Mala Strana

The "Lesser Town" sits between Charles Bridge and the castle, full of Baroque churches, quiet courtyards, and cobblestone streets that feel like a different century. Wander without a map. Get lost. That is the whole point.

## Practical Information

### Getting Around

Prague's public transport system is excellent. The metro, trams, and buses all run on the same ticket system, and a 24-hour pass costs about €5. Trams are my favourite way to move around — they cover the entire city, run frequently, and give you a rolling tour of the architecture. Taxis are generally reliable if you use apps like Bolt or Liftago, but honestly, between the tram network and walking, you rarely need one.

### Food Beyond Beer

Czech cuisine is hearty — roasted pork knee, svickova (marinated beef with creamy sauce and dumplings), and fried cheese. It pairs perfectly with beer. Vietnamese restaurants are surprisingly common and excellent, a legacy of the Czech-Vietnamese community dating back decades.

### Day Trips

Kutna Hora, an hour east by train, is home to the Sedlec Ossuary — a chapel decorated with bones of 40,000 people. Cesky Krumlov, a UNESCO town in South Bohemia, is another popular day trip, though I would recommend staying overnight to enjoy it after the tour buses leave.

## When to Visit

May, June, September, and October are the ideal months. Summers (July-August) bring heat and peak crowds. Winter has its charm — Christmas markets in Old Town Square are genuinely magical — but short days and freezing temperatures limit how much time you want to spend outdoors. Shoulder season gives you pleasant weather, manageable crowds, and the best prices.

### Scott's Tips for Prague

1. **Sunrise on Charles Bridge is non-negotiable.** I cannot stress this enough. The difference between 6am and 10am on that bridge is the difference between a transcendent experience and a crowded disappointment. Set the alarm.

2. **Drink beer where the locals drink beer.** The tourist pubs on Old Town Square charge double and serve mediocre lager. Walk ten minutes in any direction and you will find a hospoda where a half-litre costs under €2 and the beer is fresh from the tank.

3. **Buy a 72-hour transit pass.** At roughly €14, it pays for itself quickly and frees you from worrying about individual tickets. Trams are the best way to see the city — ride the 22 line from end to end for a free architectural tour.

4. **Eat trdelnik with caution.** The chimney cake pastries sold on every corner are marketed as "traditional Czech food." They are not — they are a recent tourist import. They taste fine, but do not skip actual Czech cuisine in favour of them. Try svickova or veprove koleno instead.

5. **Visit Vyshehrad for castle views without castle crowds.** This hilltop fortress south of the centre has stunning Vltava views, a beautiful cemetery where Dvorak is buried, and a fraction of the tourists you will find at Prague Castle. Pack a picnic and enjoy it.
