  - { question: "Is Dubrovnik too crowded and expensive?", answer: "It can be, but timing is everything. July and August bring cruise ships and peak prices. Visit in May, early June, September, or October and you get warm swimming weather, a fraction of the crowds, and noticeably lower accommodation costs. Early morning and evening in Old Town are magical even in summer." }
  - { question: "Is the Game of Thrones connection still relevant?", answer: "The filming locations are genuinely interesting even if you have not seen the show, because they highlight the most architecturally stunning parts of the city. Guided GOT tours run daily. The city walls, Fort Lovrijenac, and the Rector's Palace all featured prominently. The hype has calmed down compared to peak years, which actually makes the tours more enjoyable now." }

Dubrovnik hit me differently than I expected. I had seen the photos — terracotta rooftops, turquoise water, massive stone walls — and assumed the reality would feel smaller, more tourist-worn. Instead, the first time I walked through the Pile Gate and onto the polished limestone of the Stradun, the scale and beauty of the place were genuinely overwhelming. The walls tower above you, the stone glows in the Adriatic light, and despite everything you have heard about crowds and cruise ships, the old city retains a gravity that transcends tourism.

## Why Dubrovnik Demands Respect

This city has earned its reputation the hard way. Dubrovnik — historically known as Ragusa — was an independent republic for centuries, a maritime power that rivalled Venice. The walls you walk today were built to defend that independence. During the Croatian War in 1991-92, the city endured a devastating siege and bombardment. The meticulous restoration that followed is a testament to how much this place means to its people and to world heritage. When you walk the walls now, you are not just sightseeing. You are walking through history that is both ancient and painfully recent.

## The City Walls

The wall circuit is approximately two kilometres long and takes about 90 minutes at a comfortable pace. It is the single best thing to do in Dubrovnik, full stop. The views shift constantly — terracotta rooftops from above, the harbour from the eastern ramparts, the open Adriatic from the seaward side, and Fort Lovrijenac perched on its cliff from the western stretch. I went in the early morning, about 30 minutes after the gates opened, and for the first section I had the walls nearly to myself.

Entry costs about €35, which is steep, but it is a once-in-a-lifetime walk. Bring water — there is no shade on most of the circuit, and in summer the stone radiates heat. The Pile Gate entrance tends to be less crowded than the Ploce Gate entrance. Walk counterclockwise for the best photo sequence.

## Old Town

### The Stradun

The main street of Old Town is a 300-metre-long limestone promenade connecting the Pile Gate to the Ploce Gate. The stone underfoot has been polished by centuries of footsteps until it gleams. In the morning, before the cruise ship passengers arrive, the Stradun has an almost ethereal quality — the light bouncing off the stone, locals opening their shutters, cats stretching on doorsteps. By midday in summer, it becomes a river of people. Time your visit accordingly.

### Side Streets and Hidden Squares

The real character of Old Town lives in the narrow alleys climbing steeply north from the Stradun. These limestone staircases lead to tiny squares, family-run restaurants with five tables, laundry hanging between buildings, and views over rooftops to the sea. I spent an afternoon with no agenda, just following stairs upward wherever they led, and it was the most memorable few hours of my visit. Get lost on purpose. The city is small enough that you always find your way back.

### Fort Lovrijenac

This fortress perched on a 37-metre cliff outside the western wall is sometimes called "Dubrovnik's Gibraltar." The interior is used as a theatre venue during the Dubrovnik Summer Festival, but any time of year you can climb to the top for one of the most dramatic views of the city walls from the outside. Entry is included with the city walls ticket. Do not skip it.

## Beyond the Walls

### Lokrum Island

A 15-minute ferry from the Old Port delivers you to Lokrum, an uninhabited island that feels like Dubrovnik's backyard escape. There is a botanical garden, a ruined Benedictine monastery, a saltwater lake called the Dead Sea, and peacocks roaming everywhere. The rocky swimming spots on the south side of the island are excellent. I spent half a day here — swimming, walking the trails, eating a packed lunch on the rocks — and it was the perfect antidote to Old Town crowds.

### Island Hopping

The Elaphiti Islands — Kolocep, Lopud, and Sipan — are reachable by public ferry and offer quiet beaches, hiking trails, and seafood restaurants without Dubrovnik's prices. Lopud is my pick: car-free, with a sandy beach (Sunj) on the far side of the island that you reach by a pleasant 20-minute walk through subtropical vegetation. A full-day island-hopping tour covers all three islands and costs around €40-50.

## Practical Information

### The Cruise Ship Reality

Dubrovnik receives thousands of cruise ship passengers daily during peak season. The pattern is predictable: passengers flood Old Town from roughly 10am to 4pm, then leave. Plan your exploration for early morning or late afternoon. Stay overnight and you get the city to yourself in the evening.

### Food and Drink

Dalmatian cuisine is Mediterranean at its core — olive oil, fresh seafood, grilled vegetables, and wine. Prices inside Old Town are high by Croatian standards but reasonable by Western European ones. A seafood platter at a good restaurant runs €25-40. For better value, eat at the small restaurants in the alleys above the Stradun or venture outside the Ploce Gate to the neighbourhood of Gruz, where locals eat. Fresh oysters from nearby Ston are exceptional and available at several restaurants in town.

### Getting Around

Old Town is entirely pedestrian and compact — you can walk end to end in 15 minutes. Buses connect Old Town to the surrounding neighbourhoods, Lapad beach area, and the bus station. The Dubrovnik Card (available for 1, 3, or 7 days) bundles city wall entry, museum access, and bus transport into one ticket, which can save money if you plan to see multiple sights.

### Scott's Tips for Dubrovnik

1. **Walk the walls at opening time.** Gates open at 8am in summer. Be there at 8am. By 10am, the cruise ship passengers arrive and the walls become congested. The early morning light is also far better for photography.

2. **Stay inside Old Town for at least one night.** The apartments inside the walls are not cheap, but waking up and stepping onto the Stradun before anyone else is there is an experience no day trip can replicate. The city at 7am belongs to residents and the fortunate few who slept within the walls.

3. **Escape to Lokrum when you need a break.** The 15-minute ferry runs frequently, and the island is the perfect half-day reset. Bring a towel, a book, and some food — the island's single cafe is overpriced. Swim in the Dead Sea lagoon for calm, warm water.

4. **Eat outside the Pile Gate, not inside.** Restaurants just outside the western gate in the Bokar area and down toward Lapad offer the same quality at significantly lower prices. The location premium inside Old Town is steep, and the food is not always better.

5. **Take the cable car to Mount Srd at sunset.** The panoramic view from the top — Old Town, Lokrum, the Elaphiti Islands, and the open Adriatic — is the best vantage point in Dubrovnik. The cable car costs about €27 return, or you can hike the zigzag trail up for free in about an hour.
