## Why Vilnius Stole a Week From Me

Vilnius is the kind of city that does not announce itself. It sits quietly at the confluence of the Neris and Vilnia rivers, surrounded by forested hills, with a Baroque Old Town so perfectly preserved that walking through it feels like stepping into an 18th-century painting. Lithuania's capital does not have the immediate drama of Prague or the legendary nightlife of Belgrade. What it has is something subtler — a warmth, a creative eccentricity, and an affordability that makes you want to extend your stay again and again.

I arrived with a vague two-day plan and left a week later. The city kept revealing hidden layers: a street art alley I had not noticed, a courtyard restaurant where the chef grows herbs on the windowsill, a jazz bar in a medieval cellar. Vilnius rewards the curious, unhurried traveler, and it does so at prices that feel almost unfair compared to Western Europe.

## The Old Town

### A Baroque Masterpiece

Vilnius Old Town is the largest Baroque old town in Eastern Europe and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It sprawls across gentle hills, its charm lying in the variety — Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Neoclassical buildings stand side by side along winding streets. Pilies Street is the main artery, lined with amber shops, galleries, and cafes, but the best discoveries happen on the side streets where hidden courtyards reveal gardens and centuries-old wells.

The centerpiece is Vilnius Cathedral, a Neoclassical structure that looks more like a Greek temple than a Baltic church. The free-standing bell tower beside it is one of Vilnius's most recognizable landmarks. The Cathedral Square in front is the city's main gathering point, where festivals, markets, and concerts take place throughout the year.

### Gate of Dawn (Ausros Vartai)

The Gate of Dawn is the only surviving gate of the original city wall and one of the most important religious sites in Lithuania. The chapel above the gate houses a miraculous painting of the Blessed Virgin Mary that draws pilgrims from across the Catholic world. Standing in the small chapel, watching devotees pray before the gilded icon while traffic passes through the medieval gate below, is one of those moments that captures the layered reality of Vilnius perfectly.

### Gediminas Tower

The red-brick tower perched atop a steep hill is what remains of the Upper Castle, the fortress that has watched over Vilnius since the 14th century. You can hike up the forested hillside in about 10 minutes or take the funicular. The tower itself houses a small museum, but the reason to come is the panoramic view — a 360-degree sweep across the Old Town, the river, the TV tower, and the green hills that ring the city. I hiked up at sunset when the Baroque spires and terracotta rooftops glow amber in the fading light.

## Uzupis: The Republic Within a Republic

Uzupis began as a neglected neighborhood on the other side of the Vilnia River from the Old Town. Artists and bohemians moved in during the 1990s because rents were cheap, and on April 1, 1998, they declared independence. The Uzupis Republic has its own constitution — 41 articles including "Everyone has the right to be happy" and "A cat is not obliged to love its owner, but must help in times of need" — displayed on a mirrored wall in dozens of languages.

Today, Uzupis is Vilnius's creative heart. Galleries, studios, and quirky cafes fill the narrow streets, and the artistic spirit is genuine rather than commercial. Even on ordinary days, the atmosphere is distinct — freer, stranger, and more playful than anywhere else in the city.

## Food and Drink

Lithuanian cuisine has roots in peasant cooking but has evolved into something genuinely interesting. Cepelinai — massive potato dumplings stuffed with meat or curd cheese, served with sour cream and bacon — are the national dish and an absolute must-try. Saltibarsciai, a cold beet soup served in summer, is unexpectedly refreshing. Dark rye bread with smoked fish or cured meats makes an excellent snack or light meal.

For dining out, Gaspar's serves modern Lithuanian cuisine in a stylish Old Town setting, while Mykolo 4 offers a farm-to-table approach with seasonal menus. For budget eating, the Hales Market (Hales Turgus) near the train station has food stalls serving Lithuanian and international dishes at rock-bottom prices.

### Craft Beer and Nightlife

Lithuania has a deep beer-brewing tradition, and the craft scene has exploded in recent years. Snekutis, a tiny no-frills bar in Uzupis, serves some of the best local craft beers for around €2 a pint. Bambalyne, in a medieval cellar, offers a wider selection alongside hearty Lithuanian food. For cocktails, Alchemikas and Nomads are standout bars with creative menus.

## Day Trip: Hill of Crosses

The Hill of Crosses near Siauliai, about 220 km north of Vilnius, is one of the most extraordinary sights in the Baltics. Hundreds of thousands of crosses — from tiny crucifixes to towering wooden structures — cover a small hill in a flat, windswept landscape. Soviet authorities bulldozed it at least three times, and each time Lithuanians rebuilt it overnight. Today, the hill holds an estimated 200,000 crosses and the number grows daily. It is a powerful, eerie, and deeply moving place. Buses run from Vilnius to Siauliai (about 2.5 hours), from where a local bus or taxi covers the final 12 km.

## Getting Around Vilnius

The Old Town is entirely walkable. Public buses and trolleybuses cover the wider city at about €1 per ride with an electronic card. Bolt is the ride-hailing app of choice — a trip across the entire city rarely exceeds €5. Vilnius is also bike-friendly, with a public bike-sharing system called Cyclocity.

### Scott's Tips for Vilnius

1. **Climb Gediminas Tower at sunset.** The views are spectacular any time, but in the hour before sunset, the light transforms the Old Town into gold. Take the funicular up if you are short on time, but the walk through the park is pleasant and takes only 10 minutes.

2. **Read the Uzupis Constitution wall.** Find the mirrored wall on Paupio Street where the constitution is displayed in over 30 languages. It is a surprisingly thought-provoking read and makes for a great photo. The English translation is usually on the left side.

3. **Eat cepelinai at Etno Dvaras.** This chain of traditional Lithuanian restaurants serves some of the best cepelinai in Vilnius at very reasonable prices. One serving is enormous — I have never managed to finish two. Pair it with a glass of Lithuanian beer.

4. **Visit Hales Market for breakfast.** This indoor market near the train station is where locals shop and eat. The coffee stands, bakeries, and deli counters make it the perfect spot for an affordable, authentic breakfast before a day of sightseeing.

5. **Combine the Hill of Crosses with a stop in Kaunas.** If you rent a car, visit Lithuania's second city on the way to or from the Hill of Crosses. Kaunas has an excellent Old Town, vibrant street art, and the unique Devils Museum — a collection of over 3,000 devil figurines from around the world.
