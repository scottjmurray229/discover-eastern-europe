## Why Sofia Surprised Me

I will be honest: Sofia was not originally high on my list. But this Bulgarian capital turned out to be one of the most rewarding cities I have visited in Eastern Europe. It is a place where you can stand on a glass platform above Roman ruins in a modern metro station, hike a 2,290-meter mountain before lunch, and eat one of the best meals of your trip for under €8. Sofia operates on a different rhythm than Western European capitals — slower, less polished, but deeply authentic.

What struck me most was the layering. Two thousand years of history sit stacked on top of each other here. The ancient Serdica complex beneath the streets dates back to the Roman Emperor Constantine, who reportedly said, "Serdica is my Rome." Medieval churches sit beside Ottoman mosques, and Soviet-era monuments share boulevards with sleek new restaurants and galleries. Sofia does not hide its past. It builds on top of it, literally.

## The Essential Sights

### Alexander Nevsky Cathedral

This is the image that defines Sofia's skyline. The Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, completed in 1912, is a neo-Byzantine masterpiece with golden domes that glow against the mountain backdrop. The interior is dim, candle-lit, and heavy with incense — exactly the atmosphere that Orthodox cathedrals do best. The crypt downstairs houses an impressive collection of Bulgarian icons spanning several centuries. I visited twice: once in the morning when the light through the windows creates ethereal patterns, and again at dusk when the domes catch the last of the sun.

### Vitosha Mountain

The fact that you can take a city bus from downtown Sofia and be standing at the trailhead of a legitimate mountain within 30 minutes is extraordinary. Vitosha Nature Park offers trails for every fitness level, from gentle forest walks to the challenging summit of Cherni Vrah at 2,290 meters. I took the Dragalevtsi gondola up and hiked the Stone River trail — a surreal stretch of massive granite boulders that looks like a frozen river of rock. In winter, Vitosha doubles as a ski resort, making Sofia one of the few European capitals where you can hit the slopes on your lunch break.

### Boyana Church

This small medieval church on the outskirts of Sofia punches far above its weight. The frescoes inside, painted in 1259, are considered masterpieces of European medieval art. The expressions on the faces are so lifelike and naturalistic that they predate the Italian Renaissance by nearly 200 years. Visits are limited to 15-minute slots to protect the paintings, so book ahead. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for good reason.

### The Roman Ruins Beneath Your Feet

The Serdica archaeological complex is accessible from the metro underpass near the Presidency building, and it is free. You walk among the excavated streets, walls, and buildings of the ancient Roman city that once thrived here. The Largo area nearby reveals even more layers, including the rotunda of St. George, a 4th-century church that is the oldest building in Sofia, tucked in a courtyard between the Presidency and a Sheraton hotel. The juxtaposition is quintessentially Sofia.

## Where to Eat

Bulgarian cuisine is a wonderful collision of Balkan, Mediterranean, and Turkish influences. Start every meal with a shopska salad — tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and peppers buried under a snowdrift of grated sirene cheese. For mains, try kavarma (a slow-cooked meat and vegetable stew), kebapche (grilled minced meat), or the incredible bean soup called bob chorba.

The Central Market Hall (Tsentralni Hali) is a good spot for an affordable lunch in a beautiful neo-Renaissance building. For a more refined experience, the restaurants along Vitosha Boulevard and in the neighborhoods around Oborishte Street offer inventive takes on Bulgarian classics. Made in Home was a personal favorite — creative comfort food in a quirky, eclectic space.

### Drinking Culture

Bulgarians take their rakia seriously. This fruit brandy, usually made from grapes or plums, is the national drink and is served at the start of meals. Accept when offered and sip slowly — it is stronger than it tastes. The craft beer scene in Sofia has also taken off in recent years, with bars like Kanaal and Dada Cultural Bar serving local brews in atmospheric settings.

## Navigating the City

Sofia's metro system is modern, clean, and easy to use. Two lines cover the main tourist areas and connect to the airport and bus stations. Single rides cost about €0.80. Above ground, the tram network is extensive if a bit rattly, and ride-sharing apps like Bolt and Yellow Taxi work reliably.

Most of what you want to see in the city center is within walking distance. I found the area between the National Palace of Culture (NDK) and the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral to be the most rewarding stretch for wandering, with parks, cafes, and street performers along the way.

## Day Trips Worth Taking

### Rila Monastery

Bulgaria's most famous landmark is about 120 km south of Sofia, nestled in a valley at 1,147 meters elevation. The monastery's striped arches, vibrant frescoes, and mountain setting are spectacular. Direct buses from Sofia's Ovcha Kupel station make the trip in around 2 hours. Go early and plan to spend 3-4 hours exploring the complex and the surrounding trails.

### Plovdiv

Bulgaria's second city is only 1.5 hours by train and was a European Capital of Culture in 2019. The old town, perched on a hill with colorful Revival-era houses, Roman ruins, and cobblestone streets, is charming enough to warrant an overnight stay if your schedule allows.

### Scott's Tips for Sofia

1. **Get the Sofia City Card.** For about €25, you get free public transport, museum entry, and a free walking tour. It pays for itself within a day if you are hitting the main sights.

2. **Book Boyana Church in advance.** Slots fill up fast, especially in summer. Reserve online at least a few days ahead. The 15-minute time limit feels short, but the small space means you can see everything if you focus.

3. **Hike Vitosha on a weekday.** Weekends bring half of Sofia to the mountain, and the gondola lines get long. A Tuesday or Wednesday morning hike will give you trails practically to yourself.

4. **Do the free walking tour.** Sofia's free walking tour (tip-based) is one of the best I have experienced in Europe. The guides are passionate locals who cover history, culture, and practical tips. It starts daily at 10 AM and 6 PM near the Palace of Justice.

5. **Try the mineral water fountains.** Sofia sits on natural hot springs, and free mineral water fountains are scattered around the city. The one outside the Central Mineral Baths building is the most popular. Locals fill up jugs here daily — the water is warm, slightly mineralized, and completely free.
