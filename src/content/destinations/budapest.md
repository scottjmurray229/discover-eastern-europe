  - { question: "Are the thermal baths worth visiting?", answer: "Absolutely. The thermal baths are not a tourist gimmick — they are a genuine part of Hungarian daily life dating back to the Ottoman era. Szechenyi is the most famous, but Gellert offers a more Art Nouveau experience and Rudas has a rooftop pool with Danube views. Budget around €15-25 for entry depending on the bath." }
  - { question: "What is the best area to stay in Budapest?", answer: "District VII (the Jewish Quarter) puts you in the middle of the ruin bar and restaurant scene. District V (Belvaros) is more upscale and central. Buda side is quieter and more residential. For first-time visitors, District VII offers the best combination of atmosphere, food, nightlife, and value." }

Budapest is really two cities stitched together by bridges. Buda rises on the western bank — hilly, regal, and quiet. Pest sprawls across the east — flat, bustling, and full of the kind of creative chaos that makes a city feel truly alive. The Danube runs between them, and from almost any vantage point along its banks, the view is staggering. I have stood on the Chain Bridge at dusk watching Parliament light up gold against the darkening sky, and it is one of those travel moments that genuinely stops you in your tracks.

## Why Budapest Stands Out

Budapest punches well above its weight. The city has thermal baths fed by natural hot springs that have been in use since the Ottoman occupation, a nightlife scene built inside crumbling pre-war buildings, Art Nouveau architecture that rivals Vienna's, and food that ranges from hearty paprika-laden stews to Michelin-starred tasting menus. And it does all of this at prices that make Western European capitals look absurd. A sit-down lunch with a beer rarely costs more than €8. Entry to the famous Szechenyi Baths is about €25 for a full day. You can live well here on a modest budget.

## The Thermal Baths

### Szechenyi

The largest medicinal bath in Europe, Szechenyi is the one you see on every Instagram feed — yellow Neo-Baroque buildings surrounding steaming outdoor pools where locals play chess on floating boards. It is genuinely impressive. I went on a weekday morning in October and had entire sections to myself. The thermal water is rich in minerals, the steam rises into the cool air, and you understand immediately why Hungarians have made bathing a cultural institution. Weekend afternoons get crowded, so plan accordingly.

### Gellert

If Szechenyi is grand, Gellert is elegant. The Art Nouveau interior with its mosaic tiles, columns, and ornate pools feels like bathing in a palace. It is slightly more expensive and draws a slightly older crowd. I preferred the atmosphere here for a quieter, more meditative soak.

### Rudas

Rudas has Ottoman-era bones — the central octagonal pool under a domed roof dates to the 1500s. The modern addition is a rooftop pool with direct views of the Danube and the Pest skyline. I went for the rooftop at sunset, and it was one of the best €20 I spent on the entire trip.

## Buda Side

### Buda Castle and Castle Hill

The castle district is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the views from Fisherman's Bastion alone justify the climb (or funicular ride). The bastion's white stone terraces frame a postcard-perfect panorama of Parliament and the Danube. Inside the castle complex, the Hungarian National Gallery houses an excellent collection of Hungarian art, and the Budapest History Museum gives you the archaeological layers beneath the castle. The district is compact and walkable — a half-day covers the main sights comfortably.

### Gellert Hill and the Citadella

The hike up Gellert Hill is steep but short, and the 360-degree view from the top is the most complete panorama of Budapest you will find. The Citadella fortress at the summit is under renovation, but the viewpoint alone makes it worthwhile. I went just before sunset, watched the city transition from daylight to illuminated gold, and stayed until the Parliament building was fully lit. Bring a jacket — it gets windy up there.

## Pest Side

### The Jewish Quarter and Ruin Bars

The VII District, once the old Jewish Quarter, is now the epicentre of Budapest's nightlife and food scene. The ruin bars — built inside abandoned buildings and courtyards — are unlike anything else in Europe. Szimpla Kert is the original and most famous, a sprawling labyrinth of mismatched furniture and street art. On a Saturday night, it is packed and chaotic in the best way. Sundays, Szimpla hosts a farmers' market worth visiting on its own.

Beyond Szimpla, the Jewish Quarter has dozens of bars and restaurants. Mazel Tov serves Middle Eastern food in a gorgeous greenhouse setting. Bors GasztroBar does inventive soups in a standing-room-only space.

### Parliament

The Hungarian Parliament building is one of the most beautiful legislative buildings in the world — a Gothic Revival masterpiece that sits right on the Danube. Tours of the interior run daily and are worth the €10 entry. The main staircase, the assembly hall, and the Hungarian Crown Jewels are genuinely impressive. Book your tour online in advance because slots fill up quickly, especially in summer.

### The Great Market Hall

This iron-and-glass market hall near Liberty Bridge is where locals and tourists overlap. The ground floor has butchers, produce vendors, and stalls selling paprika and salami. The upper floor has food stands where you can eat langos (deep-fried dough with sour cream and cheese) for a few euros. Go in the morning when it is quieter.

## Practical Information

### Getting Around

Budapest has an efficient metro, tram, and bus system. The M1 metro line, running under Andrassy Avenue, is the oldest electrified underground railway in continental Europe — and it is still in daily use. A 24-hour transit pass costs about €5.50 and covers everything. Tram 2, which runs along the Pest side of the Danube, offers one of the best free sightseeing rides in Europe — Parliament, Chain Bridge, and the castle district all visible from the window.

### Food and Drink

Hungarian cuisine revolves around paprika, pork, and slow-cooked comfort. Goulash here is a soup, not the thick stew you might expect. Langos from a market stall is the perfect cheap lunch. Hungarian wine — particularly Egri Bikaver and Tokaji — deserves more recognition. A bottle of excellent wine costs €5-10 in a shop.

### Safety

Budapest is generally very safe. Watch for pickpockets on busy trams and in tourist areas. Use Bolt rather than hailing cabs on the street.

### Scott's Tips for Budapest

1. **Visit the baths on a weekday morning.** Szechenyi on a Saturday afternoon is a crowded party. On a Tuesday morning, it is a serene, steaming oasis. The experience is completely different, and the weekday version is the one I recommend.

2. **Take Tram 2 along the Danube at night.** This is the cheapest sightseeing tour in the city. Parliament lit up in gold, the Chain Bridge glowing, the castle on the hill — all from a €1.50 tram ticket.

3. **Eat langos at the Great Market Hall, not from tourist stands.** The market version is freshly fried and costs half the price of the ones sold near the main squares. Get it with sour cream and cheese — skip the Nutella version.

4. **Cross the Chain Bridge on foot at sunset.** Start on the Pest side, walk across to Buda, then take the funicular or walk up to the castle district. The timing puts you at Fisherman's Bastion as the city lights come on.

5. **Explore beyond the ruin bars.** Szimpla Kert is worth seeing once, but the Jewish Quarter has so much more — Mazel Tov for dinner, Bors GasztroBar for soup, and small wine bars on Kazinczy Street that feel nothing like the party scene one block over.
