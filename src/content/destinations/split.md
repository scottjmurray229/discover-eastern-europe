  - { question: "How does Split compare to Dubrovnik?", answer: "Split is less polished and more authentic. Dubrovnik is a museum-city; Split is a working port where Roman ruins serve as apartment walls and restaurants operate inside ancient cellars. Split is also more affordable, less crowded, and better positioned as a base for island hopping. Many travellers prefer it precisely because it feels more real." }
  - { question: "Which islands should I visit from Split?", answer: "Hvar is the most popular — glamorous, with excellent restaurants and nightlife. Brac has Zlatni Rat, one of Croatia's most photographed beaches. Vis is the most remote and unspoiled. For a single day trip, Brac is easiest (50 minutes by catamaran). For an overnight, Hvar is the best all-round experience." }

Split is not a preserved monument. It is a living, breathing, slightly chaotic city built inside and around a Roman emperor's retirement palace. That distinction matters. Where Dubrovnik can feel like a beautiful stage set, Split feels like a place where people actually live — because they do. Locals hang laundry from windows set into 1,700-year-old walls, restaurants serve grilled fish in converted Roman cellars, and the cathedral was literally built inside the emperor's mausoleum. I walked into Diocletian's Palace through the Bronze Gate, and within five minutes I had passed a Roman column, a medieval church, a modern cafe, and a grandmother yelling down to the street from her apartment. That is Split in a nutshell.

## Diocletian's Palace

### Understanding the Palace

Emperor Diocletian built this massive complex around 305 AD as his retirement residence, combining imperial villa and military fortress. After the Roman Empire fell, locals moved in, and they have never left. Today, the palace is not a ruin you observe from behind ropes. It is the living core of Split's Old Town, with about 3,000 people residing within its walls.

### The Peristyle

The central courtyard of the palace is the Peristyle, a colonnaded square that was once the ceremonial entrance to Diocletian's private quarters. Today, the steps serve as the city's living room. People sit on the ancient stone, drink coffee from the surrounding cafes, and listen to occasional live music that echoes off the Roman arches. I sat here for an hour on my first evening, drinking a macchiato and watching the light change on the columns. No museum could replicate this feeling.

### The Cathedral of Saint Domnius

The cathedral occupies Diocletian's original mausoleum — making it one of the oldest cathedral buildings in the world still in continuous use. The bell tower, added in the Middle Ages, is climbable for a panoramic view over the palace complex and the harbour. The 183-step climb is narrow and exposed near the top, but the 360-degree view from the summit — rooftops, islands, mountains — is Split's best.

### The Basement Halls

Beneath the palace's main floor, a network of subterranean halls has survived remarkably intact. These cellars were used as a garbage dump for centuries, which ironically preserved them. They mirror the floor plan of the imperial apartments above and give you a sense of the palace's original scale and engineering. During summer, they host exhibitions and markets. Even without events, they are worth exploring — the vaulted stone spaces are cool, atmospheric, and surprisingly large.

## The Waterfront and Beyond

### The Riva

Split's Riva promenade stretches along the harbour front, lined with palm trees, cafes, and the gleaming white facade of the palace's southern wall. This is where the city socialises. In the evening, the Riva fills with families, couples, and groups of friends doing the Mediterranean passeggiata — a slow walk with no destination other than being seen and enjoying the air. I joined the flow, stopped for an ice cream, and watched the ferries glide in from the islands as the sun dropped behind the hills.

### Marjan Hill

West of the Old Town, the forested Marjan peninsula rises above the harbour. Walking or cycling the trails through the pine forest feels like leaving the city entirely, even though you are minutes from the palace. The summit viewpoint offers a sweeping panorama — the city, the harbour, the islands of Brac, Hvar, and Solta scattered across the blue. I hiked up in the late afternoon, found a bench at the top, and stayed until sunset. It was one of those moments where the simplest plan turned out to be the best one.

## Island Hopping from Split

Split's harbour is the main ferry hub for the central Dalmatian islands, and this connectivity is one of the best reasons to base yourself here.

### Brac and Zlatni Rat

The island of Brac is a 50-minute catamaran ride away. Zlatni Rat (Golden Horn), near the town of Bol, is a distinctive tongue-shaped pebble beach that shifts with the currents. It is one of the most photographed spots in Croatia, and it genuinely lives up to the images.

### Hvar

Hvar Town is the glamour island — luxury yachts in the harbour, cocktail bars in the fortress, lavender fields in the interior. It is more expensive than Split but undeniably beautiful. I took the afternoon catamaran, spent a night in a modest guesthouse, explored the back streets and the hilltop fortress at sunset, and returned the next morning. That pacing felt right — enough to absorb the atmosphere without the price tag of a longer stay.

### Vis

The farthest major island from Split, Vis was a Yugoslav military base until 1989 and was closed to tourists for decades. That isolation preserved something special. Vis is quieter, less developed, and home to some of the best seafood restaurants on the Adriatic.

## Practical Information

### Food

Dalmatian cuisine revolves around the sea and the grill. Grilled fresh fish with olive oil and lemon is the staple. Black risotto (crni rizot) made with cuttlefish ink is rich and deeply flavoured. Pasticada, a slow-braised beef stew, is the region's signature meat dish. Bakeries sell burek for a couple of euros — perfect grab-and-go fuel.

### Getting Around

The Old Town and palace area are entirely walkable. Buses connect the centre to the suburbs and nearby Trogir (a UNESCO gem, 30 minutes by bus). Ferries and catamarans to the islands depart from the harbour directly in front of the Riva. Book catamarans in advance during summer — popular routes sell out.

### Scott's Tips for Split

1. **Arrive through the Bronze Gate.** Most visitors enter the palace from the north (Golden Gate). Coming through the basement halls via the Bronze Gate on the Riva side is more atmospheric — you emerge from underground vaults directly into the Peristyle. It sets the tone for the whole visit.

2. **Climb the cathedral bell tower early in the morning.** The narrow staircase means only a few people can be up top at once. Go early to avoid the queue and get the best light on the harbour and islands. The last few metres are steep metal stairs with open air on both sides — not ideal if you dislike heights, but the view is extraordinary.

3. **Take a sunset hike up Marjan Hill.** Skip the taxi and walk from the Old Town. The trail through the pine forest is well-marked, and the viewpoint at the top times perfectly with golden hour. Bring a drink — there is nothing to buy up there.

4. **Buy ferry tickets in advance for summer island trips.** Catamaran routes to Hvar and Vis sell out, especially the morning departures. Book on the Jadrolinija or Krilo websites at least a few days ahead. The slow car ferries to Brac rarely sell out for foot passengers, but the catamarans are faster and more comfortable.

5. **Eat at the Green Market, not on the Riva.** The Riva restaurants charge a premium for the view. Walk one block inland to the Pazar market area and the streets behind the palace for better food at lower prices. Konoba Matejuska, just west of the Riva, serves excellent seafood without the tourist markup.
