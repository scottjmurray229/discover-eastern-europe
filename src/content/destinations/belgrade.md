## Why Belgrade Gets Under Your Skin

Belgrade is not a city that seduces you with postcard beauty. It seduces you with attitude. The Serbian capital sits at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, a strategic position that has seen the city destroyed and rebuilt over 40 times throughout its history. That resilience has produced a place with an unmistakable energy — raw, generous, defiant, and absolutely addictive.

I came to Belgrade expecting to stay three days. I stayed for eight. The city has a way of pulling you into its rhythm. Lunch stretches into afternoon coffee, coffee drifts into rakija at a kafana, and before you know it, you are on a splav at 3 AM watching the sun come up over the Danube with people you met four hours ago. Belgrade does not do things halfway.

## The Landmarks

### Kalemegdan Fortress

Perched above the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, Kalemegdan is Belgrade's soul. The fortress complex dates back to Celtic and Roman times, though what you see today is largely the work of medieval Serbian despots and later Ottoman and Austrian builders. Beyond the historical structures, the real draw is the atmosphere. Locals come here to walk, play chess, practice tai chi, and watch the sunset. The view from the Pobednik (Victor) monument, looking out over the meeting of the two rivers and the flat Vojvodina plains beyond, is one of the finest urban panoramas in Europe. I returned every evening I was in Belgrade.

### Skadarlija

Belgrade's answer to Montmartre, Skadarlija is a short cobblestone street lined with traditional Serbian restaurants called kafanas. Live musicians roam between tables playing folk music, waiters recommend dishes with genuine enthusiasm, and the atmosphere balances between lively and intimate. It could feel touristy, but it does not — Belgraders have been eating and drinking here since the 1800s, and they still do. Order the cevapi, get a carafe of house wine, and settle in. Nobody rushes you in Skadarlija.

### Nikola Tesla Museum

This small but fascinating museum dedicated to Serbia's most famous son houses original documents, models, and personal belongings of the inventor. The interactive demonstrations of Tesla's inventions, including a working Tesla coil that shoots actual lightning, are genuinely thrilling. English-language tours run regularly and the guides are knowledgeable and entertaining.

### Ada Ciganlija

Belgraders call it "Belgrade's Sea," and in summer that nickname makes sense. This river island in the Sava has been connected to the mainland to create an artificial lake with sandy beaches, clear water, and a 7-kilometer-long shoreline. On hot summer days, up to 300,000 people come here to swim, cycle, play sports, or barbecue. There are also bungee jumping, water skiing, and kayaking options. It is not a tourist attraction in the traditional sense — it is where the city goes to have fun, and joining them is the best way to experience Belgrade at its most relaxed.

## The Nightlife

### Splavovi: Floating River Clubs

Belgrade's most distinctive contribution to global nightlife culture is the splav — a floating club moored on the Sava or Danube river. Dozens of these barges line the riverbanks, ranging from intimate cocktail spots to massive clubs hosting international DJs. The scene typically starts around midnight and runs until well past dawn. Lasta and Freestyler are among the most established, but new venues open constantly. In summer, the energy along the river is electric. The absence of strict noise regulations, combined with the open-air waterfront setting, creates something you simply cannot find in most European cities.

### Kafanas After Dark

If the splavovi are the loud heart of Belgrade's nightlife, the kafanas are its soul. These traditional tavern-restaurants transform at night into raucous live music venues. The music ranges from traditional Serbian folk to a Balkan brass band style that gets entire rooms on their feet. Dva Jelena and Znak Pitanja (Question Mark), the oldest kafana in Belgrade dating to 1823, are excellent places to experience this. The combination of grilled meats, free-flowing rakija, and live music creates evenings that are impossible to forget.

## What to Eat

Serbian food is built for people with appetites. Portions are enormous, flavors are bold, and vegetable-free meals are entirely normal. The essentials include cevapi (grilled minced meat served in flatbread with onions and kajmak, a creamy dairy spread), pljeskavica (a supersized Serbian burger), and karadjordjeva snicla (a breaded and stuffed meat roll that is essentially a Serbian take on chicken Kiev). For breakfast, burek — flaky phyllo pastry filled with meat, cheese, or spinach — is ubiquitous and perfect. A slice of burek with a cup of yogurt from a local bakery costs under €2 and will fuel you through the morning.

The restaurant scene extends well beyond traditional fare. The Dorcol neighborhood has become a hub for contemporary dining, with wine bars and modern Balkan fusion restaurants appearing steadily. Prices remain astonishingly low — a dinner for two with wine at a good restaurant rarely exceeds €30.

## Getting Around

Belgrade's public transport consists of buses, trams, and trolleybuses. A BusPlus card loaded with credit is the easiest way to pay — available from kiosks for a few euros. However, the city center is walkable and most key sights are within a 30-minute stroll of each other. For longer distances or late-night travel, Car:Go and Bolt are the ride-hailing apps to use. Taxis are also cheap but always insist on the meter.

### Scott's Tips for Belgrade

1. **Do not go to the splavovi too early.** Arriving before midnight marks you as a tourist. Most clubs do not really fill up until 1 AM, and the peak energy hits between 2 and 4 AM. Eat a late dinner, have drinks at a kafana, then head to the river.

2. **Change money at exchange offices, not banks.** Serbia uses the Dinar, and the small "menjacnica" exchange offices scattered around the city offer better rates than banks or ATMs. They are legitimate, licensed businesses and the rates are typically posted on boards outside.

3. **Walk the Sava riverfront promenade.** The recently developed waterfront area along the Sava offers a pleasant walk with views of the splavovi, the fortress, and the new Belgrade Waterfront development. It is especially good in the late afternoon light.

4. **Try rakija flights.** Several bars in the Dorcol and Stari Grad neighborhoods offer flights of different rakija varieties — plum, quince, apricot, honey, walnut. It is the best way to appreciate the range and craft behind Serbia's national spirit.

5. **Visit the Temple of Saint Sava.** This massive Orthodox church, one of the largest in the world, recently completed its interior mosaics after decades of work. The golden interior is genuinely breathtaking and entry is free. Go in the evening when the interior lighting makes the mosaics shimmer.
