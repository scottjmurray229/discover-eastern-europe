## Why Tallinn Blew My Expectations Away

I expected a charming medieval town. I got that, plus a cutting-edge digital society, a creative arts scene punching well above its weight, and some of the best food I have had in the Baltics. Tallinn is a city of contradictions that somehow work perfectly together — 13th-century watchtowers sharing the skyline with sleek glass offices, monks' cellars converted into cocktail bars, and a nation of 1.3 million people that has produced Skype, Bolt, and one of the most advanced digital governance systems on Earth.

Estonia's capital sits on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland, just 80 kilometers from Helsinki. That proximity brings Finnish day-trippers and weekend visitors, but Tallinn has long since grown beyond being Helsinki's cheaper neighbor. It has cultivated its own identity — one that blends Nordic efficiency, Baltic soul, and a forward-thinking energy that pervades everything from its architecture to its restaurant menus.

## Exploring the Old Town

### Upper Town (Toompea)

Tallinn's Old Town is divided into an upper and lower section, and the natural place to start is at the top. Toompea Hill was the seat of power for centuries, and today it houses the Estonian Parliament in the pink Toompea Castle. The Alexander Nevsky Cathedral here, with its onion domes and ornate facade, is a striking example of Russian Orthodox architecture. But the real draw is the viewpoints. Kohtuotsa and Patkuli viewing platforms offer sweeping panoramas over the red rooftops of the Lower Town to the harbor and Baltic Sea beyond. I watched the sunset from Kohtuotsa twice — it is that good.

### Lower Town

The Lower Town is where Tallinn's medieval magic is most concentrated. Town Hall Square (Raekoja plats) is anchored by the oldest Gothic town hall in Northern Europe, dating to 1404. The narrow surrounding streets — Viru, Pikk, Lai — are lined with merchants' houses, guild halls, and churches that have stood for 500 to 800 years. What makes Tallinn's Old Town special compared to other European medieval centers is its completeness. The city walls and 20 of the original 46 towers are still standing, and you can walk along sections of the wall for a small fee. It feels less like a museum and more like a functioning neighborhood that happens to be medieval.

### St. Olav's Church

For the best aerial view of Tallinn, climb the 258 steps to the top of St. Olav's Church tower. At 124 meters, it was once the tallest building in the world (in the 1500s), and the panorama from the top encompasses the entire Old Town, the port, and on clear days, the Finnish coast. The staircase is narrow and steep — not ideal for those with claustrophobia — but the view is unmatched.

## Beyond the Walls

### Telliskivi Creative City

This former industrial complex just north of the Old Town has been transformed into Tallinn's creative heartbeat. Old factory buildings now house independent boutiques, design studios, art galleries, a flea market, and some of the city's best restaurants and bars. The street art covering the buildings changes regularly, and on weekends, the area buzzes with markets and events. Telliskivi feels like the soul of modern Tallinn — inventive, unpretentious, and constantly evolving.

### Kadriorg Palace and Park

Built by Peter the Great for his wife Catherine in the early 1700s, Kadriorg Palace is a Baroque jewel set in a sprawling English-style park. The palace now houses the Art Museum of Estonia's foreign art collection, and the park itself is one of the most pleasant green spaces in the city. The KUMU Art Museum, Estonia's largest, sits at the edge of the park in a striking modern building designed by Finnish architect Pekka Vapaavuori. Between the palace, KUMU, and the park itself, you could easily spend a full half-day here.

### Lennusadam Seaplane Harbour

This maritime museum is housed in enormous 1916-era seaplane hangars with a design so innovative they were a structural marvel of their time. Inside, you will find a full-sized submarine (the Lembit, which you can enter), an icebreaker, a century-old seaplane, and dozens of smaller vessels. The exhibits are interactive and well-designed, making this one of the best museums in the Baltics regardless of your interest in maritime history.

## Tallinn as a Digital Nomad Hub

Estonia was the first country in the world to offer e-Residency, a digital identity for global entrepreneurs. That forward-thinking ethos has made Tallinn a magnet for remote workers and tech professionals. Co-working spaces like Lift99, Spring Hub, and Workland are scattered across the city, and nearly every cafe offers reliable Wi-Fi without the passive-aggressive time limits you encounter elsewhere. The cost of living is lower than Helsinki or Stockholm but the quality of life is comparable, which explains why many digital nomads who come for a month end up staying for a year.

## Food and Drink

Estonian cuisine has undergone a renaissance in recent years. New Nordic influences blend with local traditions — think smoked fish, dark rye bread, foraged mushrooms, and seasonal berries. Rataskaevu 16 in the Old Town serves excellent updated Estonian cuisine, while Leib Resto ja Aed offers a farm-to-table experience in a beautiful courtyard setting. For a splurge, Noa Chef's Hall provides a Michelin-worthy dining experience with views across the bay.

For more casual fare, the Balti Jaama Turg market near Telliskivi has food stalls serving everything from Georgian khachapuri to Vietnamese pho. Pair it with a local Pohjala craft beer and you have an excellent budget meal.

### Scott's Tips for Tallinn

1. **Buy the Tallinn Card.** It includes free public transport, museum entries, and a walking tour. The 48-hour card (around €40) is the sweet spot — it covers KUMU, Lennusadam, and the town wall climbs, which would cost more individually.

2. **Visit the Old Town early morning or evening.** Cruise ship passengers flood the Old Town between 10 AM and 4 PM, especially in summer. Before 9 AM, you can have the cobblestone streets almost to yourself. Evening light on the limestone buildings is also magical.

3. **Take the ferry to Helsinki.** The 2-hour Tallink or Viking Line ferry is affordable and scenic. You can do a full day trip to Helsinki and still be back for dinner in Tallinn. Book online in advance for the best fares.

4. **Explore Kalamaja neighborhood.** This former fishing district north of the Old Town has become Tallinn's hippest neighborhood, with colorful wooden houses, artisan bakeries, and independent shops. It is walkable from the Old Town and connects naturally to Telliskivi and the Seaplane Harbour.

5. **Do not skip the Passages of Tallinn.** Hidden courtyards and passageways connect many Old Town streets. The Masters' Courtyard (Meistrite Hoov) on Vene Street is a cluster of artisan workshops and galleries in a medieval courtyard that most visitors walk right past. Ask at the tourist information center for a passages map.
