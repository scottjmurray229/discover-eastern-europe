  - { question: "Is Ljubljana worth visiting or just a stop on the way to Lake Bled?", answer: "Ljubljana absolutely deserves its own time. The car-free city centre, Plecnik's architectural legacy, the castle, and the restaurant scene along the Ljubljanica River make it one of the most pleasant capitals in Europe. Give it at least two full days before heading to Bled. Many travellers who planned a quick stop end up extending their stay." }
  - { question: "How do I get to Lake Bled from Ljubljana?", answer: "Buses run frequently from Ljubljana bus station to Bled (about 75 minutes, roughly €7 each way). You can also rent a car, which gives flexibility to combine Bled with the Vintgar Gorge and Bohinj Lake on the same day. The drive takes about 50 minutes through beautiful countryside." }

Ljubljana is the city that people stumble upon and immediately start telling everyone about. I had it on my list almost as an afterthought — a convenient stopover between Venice and Zagreb — and within hours of arriving I was reshuffling my entire itinerary to stay longer. The Slovenian capital is small, absurdly pretty, car-free in the centre, and genuinely committed to sustainability in a way that feels authentic rather than performative. It was named European Green Capital in 2016, and you can feel that designation in every pedestrianised street, every river-side terrace, and every patch of urban greenery.

## The Plecnik Factor

To understand Ljubljana, you need to know one name: Joze Plecnik. This Slovenian architect transformed the city in the early-to-mid 20th century with a vision that blended classical forms with modernist ideas. The Triple Bridge, the Central Market, the National and University Library, the Cobblers' Bridge, the riverside colonnades — these are all Plecnik's work, and together they give Ljubljana a coherent architectural personality that few cities its size possess. Walking through the centre feels like moving through a single architect's curated vision, and the result is remarkably harmonious.

The National and University Library is worth seeking out. The facade is austere, but step inside and a staircase leads from deliberate darkness into a luminous reading room flooded with light. Plecnik designed the journey from ignorance to enlightenment into the architecture itself.

## The Old Town

### The Ljubljanica River

The narrow Ljubljanica River curves through the centre, and its banks are the social heart of the city. Restaurants, cafes, and bars line both sides, their terraces spilling to the water's edge. On a warm evening, the scene is irresistible — people eating, drinking, talking, the water reflecting the lights of the bridges, the castle glowing on the hill above. I had dinner at a riverside table on my first night, ordered a glass of Slovenian orange wine and grilled trout, and understood immediately why people fall for this place.

### Dragon Bridge

The Art Nouveau Dragon Bridge, guarded by four green copper dragons at its corners, is Ljubljana's most recognisable landmark. The dragons are the city's symbol, appearing on everything from the coat of arms to manhole covers. The bridge itself is beautiful — one of the earliest reinforced concrete bridges in Europe when it was built in 1901 — but honestly, the dragons steal the show. There is something inherently charming about a city that chose a dragon as its mascot.

### The Central Market

Plecnik's riverside market runs along the Ljubljanica between the Triple Bridge and Dragon Bridge. Open daily except Sundays, it sells fresh produce, Slovenian cheeses, cured meats, honey, and baked goods. On Fridays from March through October, Open Kitchen (Odprta Kuhna) transforms the market into a street food festival with dozens of stalls. I went on a Friday afternoon and ate my way through Slovenian, Balkan, Asian, and Italian food in the space of an hour. It is the best food event I have encountered in any European capital of this size.

## Ljubljana Castle

The castle sits on a wooded hill directly above the Old Town, reachable by funicular (about €4 return) or by a 15-minute walk up a forested path. The current structure is mostly 16th-century, though fortifications have stood here since the 12th century. The castle itself is well-presented — there is a worthwhile history museum inside, and the watchtower offers a 360-degree panorama that on clear days extends to the Julian Alps and the Kamnik-Savinja range. I took the funicular up and walked down through the forest path, which I recommend as the best way to experience both the view and the green setting.

## Metelkova

Metelkova Mesto is Ljubljana's answer to Copenhagen's Christiania — a former military barracks transformed into an autonomous cultural centre. The buildings are covered in street art, sculpture, and murals. At night, venues host live music, DJ sets, and art events. During the day, it is quieter but visually fascinating. The contrast between the polished Plecnik-designed centre and this raw, anarchic space is part of what makes Ljubljana interesting.

## Day Trip to Lake Bled

I would be doing you a disservice if I wrote about Ljubljana without addressing Lake Bled. The glacial lake, with its island church and clifftop castle, is about 55 kilometres northwest of the capital and is one of the most iconic images in European tourism. And yes, it really does look like that. The turquoise water, the tiny island with its bell tower, the Julian Alps as backdrop — it is almost unreasonably photogenic.

Rent a traditional pletna boat to the island, ring the wishing bell in the church, and eat a cream cake (kremna rezina) at the Park Hotel cafe. Walk the 6-kilometre loop around the lake for constantly shifting perspectives. If time allows, continue to nearby Vintgar Gorge, a wooden boardwalk above turquoise rapids that is one of Slovenia's most spectacular short walks.

## Practical Information

### Food and Drink

Slovenian cuisine borrows from Italian, Austrian, and Balkan traditions. Struklji (rolled dumplings), jota (bean and sauerkraut soup), and kranjska klobasa (Carniolan sausage) are staples. The wine is excellent — orange wine (skin-contact white wine) is a Slovenian speciality gaining international recognition. A meal at a good restaurant costs about €15-25, and a glass of local wine is €3-5.

### Getting Around

Ljubljana is small enough to cover on foot. The car-free centre means no traffic noise, just people and bikes. The bike-share system (BicikeLJ) is cheap and convenient for longer distances. For day trips to Bled or Postojna Cave, buses run frequently from the central bus station.

### Scott's Tips for Ljubljana

1. **Time your visit for a Friday to catch Open Kitchen.** The weekly street food market along the Ljubljanica River is the highlight of Ljubljana's food scene. Arrive hungry, bring cash, and eat your way from stall to stall. The atmosphere on a warm Friday evening is electric.

2. **Walk up to the castle, take the funicular down.** The forested path up takes 15 minutes and gives you a workout with increasingly good views. Reward yourself with the funicular ride back down. Most people do it the other way around and miss the forest entirely.

3. **Cross every bridge you see.** Ljubljana has an unusual concentration of distinctive bridges — the Triple Bridge, Dragon Bridge, Cobblers' Bridge, Butchers' Bridge with its padlocks and glass panels. Each one is different, and the views from each reveal something new about the city's relationship with the river.

4. **Visit the National and University Library even if you are not into architecture.** The deliberate journey from the dark entrance through to the luminous reading room is a spatial experience unlike any other building I have entered. It takes five minutes and costs nothing.

5. **Combine Lake Bled with Vintgar Gorge in a single day.** Rent a car or join a tour that covers both. Bled alone is a half-day experience. Adding Vintgar Gorge, only 4 kilometres from Bled, turns it into a full day and gives you one of the most spectacular short walks in the Alps.
