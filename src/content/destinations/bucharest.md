## Why Bucharest Deserves Your Attention

Bucharest is one of those cities that catches you off guard. I arrived expecting gray Soviet blocks and left wondering why it took me so long to visit. Yes, the communist-era architecture is there, but so are Belle Epoque mansions, tree-lined boulevards, and a nightlife scene that rivals Berlin. This is a capital city where you can eat a full three-course meal for under €10, sleep in a boutique hotel for €40, and stumble into world-class contemporary art without paying a cent.

The city has been quietly reinventing itself since Romania joined the EU in 2007. A young, creative population has transformed abandoned factories into co-working spaces and neglected courtyards into open-air galleries. Bucharest does not try to be something it is not. It wears its complicated history openly, and that honesty is part of what makes it so compelling.

## The Must-See Landmarks

### Palace of Parliament

There is no way to prepare yourself for the sheer scale of this building. Commissioned by Nicolae Ceausescu in 1984, the Palace of Parliament is the heaviest building on Earth and the second-largest administrative structure after the Pentagon. Over 700 architects and 20,000 workers built it, demolishing a fifth of Bucharest's historic center in the process. The guided tours take you through only a fraction of its 1,100 rooms, but that fraction includes chandeliers weighing over a ton, marble staircases that seem to stretch endlessly, and halls that could swallow entire apartment blocks. I found the tour simultaneously awe-inspiring and deeply unsettling — which is exactly how it should feel.

### Old Town (Lipscani)

Bucharest's Old Town is where the city's pulse beats loudest. During the day, you can wander through bookshops, vintage stores, and the stunning Stavropoleos Monastery tucked between modern buildings. At night, Lipscani transforms into one of Europe's most energetic party districts. The density of bars, clubs, and terraces packed into these few blocks is remarkable. My favorite approach was to start with dinner at Caru' cu Bere, a stunning beer hall dating to 1879, then let the evening unfold from there.

### Village Museum (Muzeul Satului)

Set on the shores of Herastrau Lake, this open-air museum features over 270 authentic buildings transported from villages across Romania. Wooden churches, water mills, thatched-roof farmhouses — each structure tells a story about the country's rural traditions. I spent an entire afternoon here and could have stayed longer. It is one of the best ethnographic museums in Europe, and it rarely feels crowded.

## Exploring Ceausescu's Legacy

You cannot understand Bucharest without grappling with its communist past. Beyond the Palace of Parliament, I recommend visiting the former residence of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu at the Spring Palace, now open for tours. The mix of opulence and kitsch is surreal — gold-plated bathroom fixtures sit alongside a private cinema and indoor swimming pool, all while the Romanian people endured severe austerity. The Museum of the Romanian Peasant also provides essential context, and the Memorial of the Victims of Communism in Sighet, while a day trip, is profoundly moving.

## Where to Eat and Drink

Romanian cuisine is hearty, flavorful, and incredibly affordable. Look for traditional restaurants called "crama" or "restaurant traditional" and order the following: sarmale (cabbage rolls stuffed with spiced pork and rice), mici (grilled meat sausages served with mustard), and papanasi (fried doughnuts with sour cream and jam). A full meal with a beer at a mid-range restaurant will rarely exceed €12.

For coffee, Bucharest's specialty scene has exploded. Origo, Beans & Dots, and Steam are all excellent. In the evenings, the city's rooftop bars come alive. Nomad Skybar and the terrace at the Intercontinental offer panoramic views, while Control Club and Expirat host underground music events that run until sunrise.

### Nightlife Worth Staying Up For

Bucharest's nightlife is legendary among those who have experienced it. The city has a thriving electronic music scene, with clubs like Guesthouse and Kristal hosting international DJs regularly. What struck me most was the lack of pretension — dress codes are relaxed, cover charges are minimal or nonexistent, and the crowd is there purely for the music. In summer, many venues move outdoors, and open-air festivals pop up in parks and abandoned industrial spaces.

## Getting Around the City

Bucharest's metro system is efficient, clean, and cheap — a single ride costs about €0.50. It covers the major attractions and runs until 11:30 PM. Above ground, buses and trams are plentiful but can be slow in traffic. For late-night travel, Bolt and Uber both operate here and are remarkably affordable. A cross-city ride rarely costs more than €4.

Walking is the best way to explore the Old Town and the area around Calea Victoriei, Bucharest's grand boulevard. This stretch connects many of the city's finest buildings, including the Romanian Athenaeum, the former Royal Palace (now the National Art Museum), and Revolution Square.

## Day Trips from Bucharest

If you have extra days, the Transylvania region is accessible by train. Brasov, a charming medieval town at the foot of the Carpathians, is about 2.5 hours away by train and makes an excellent base for visiting Bran Castle (marketed as Dracula's Castle) and the Peles Castle in Sinaia. Closer to the city, Snagov Monastery sits on an island in Snagov Lake and is said to be the burial place of Vlad the Impaler.

### Scott's Tips for Bucharest

1. **Skip the airport taxi hustlers.** Order a Bolt or Uber from the arrivals hall, or take the 783 express bus. Licensed taxis are also fine, but avoid anyone who approaches you inside the terminal.

2. **Visit the Palace of Parliament early.** Book the first tour slot of the day to beat the crowds. Bring your passport — it is required for entry. The standard tour is good, but the terrace tour (available in summer) adds rooftop views that are worth the extra cost.

3. **Eat at the markets.** Obor Market is where locals shop for fresh produce, cheese, and meats. It is chaotic, authentic, and a fraction of the price of restaurant food. Grab some branza (fresh cheese) and covrigi (pretzels) for a perfect cheap breakfast.

4. **Do not underestimate distances.** Bucharest is a sprawling city, and many points of interest are further apart than they appear on a map. Use the metro for anything beyond a 15-minute walk, especially in summer when temperatures regularly exceed 35C.

5. **Learn a few Romanian phrases.** Romanians are incredibly warm to visitors who make the effort. "Multumesc" (thank you) and "Buna ziua" (good day) go a long way. You will find that many young Romanians speak excellent English, but the gesture is always appreciated.
