  - { question: "What is Black Balsam?", answer: "Riga Black Balsam is Latvia's signature herbal liqueur, made since 1752 from a secret blend of 24 botanicals. It is traditionally drunk straight, but locals also mix it with blackcurrant juice, add it to coffee, or use it in cocktails. The original version is intensely bitter — the blackcurrant variety is more approachable." }

## Why Riga Keeps Drawing Me Back

Riga has a quality that is hard to define but easy to feel. Latvia's capital is the largest city in the Baltic states, and it has the swagger to match — grand architecture, a thriving cultural scene, and a nightlife that keeps veteran travelers coming back. But it also has a rougher, more honest edge than some of its neighbors. Riga does not perform for tourists. It invites you in, hands you a glass of Black Balsam, and lets you figure things out for yourself.

What continually impresses me is the architecture. Riga has the highest concentration of Art Nouveau buildings anywhere in the world — over 800 of them — and the best examples are not tucked away in a museum. They line residential streets in the Quiet Centre district, their facades dripping with mythological figures, screaming masks, floral motifs, and geometric patterns. Turning a corner in Riga can genuinely stop you in your tracks.

## The Essential Experiences

### Art Nouveau District

Alberta iela and Elizabetes iela are the two streets where Riga's Art Nouveau splendor hits hardest. Mikhail Eisenstein, father of the famous filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, designed several of the most extravagant facades on Alberta Street. The buildings are theatrical — enormous faces peer down from cornices, sphinxes guard doorways, and peacocks strut across blue-tiled panels. The Riga Art Nouveau Museum at Alberta iela 12 recreates a period apartment interior, giving you a sense of how these stunning buildings were actually lived in. I recommend walking the district twice: once with a guidebook or audio guide for the historical context, and once just to absorb the visual overload.

### Riga Central Market

Built in the 1930s from five enormous Zeppelin hangars left over from World War I, the Central Market is one of the largest and most atmospheric markets in Europe. Each hangar specializes in a different category — meat, dairy, fish, vegetables, and baked goods. The fish pavilion alone is worth the trip, with rows of smoked fish in shades of copper and gold hanging from racks. I made a habit of assembling breakfast here each morning: smoked mackerel, dark rye bread, pickled vegetables, and a dollop of sour cream, all for under €4. The outdoor section behind the hangars has cheaper prices and a grittier atmosphere that feels more like the real Riga.

### Old Town (Vecriga)

Riga's medieval Old Town is compact, walkable, and rich with landmarks. The Riga Cathedral (Rigas Doms) is the largest medieval church in the Baltics, and its organ — with over 6,700 pipes — is one of the finest in the world. St. Peter's Church offers panoramic views from its 72-meter tower (reached by elevator, mercifully). The Three Brothers, a cluster of medieval residential houses on Maza Pils iela, represent the oldest surviving dwellings in the city. And the House of the Blackheads, a flamboyantly decorated 14th-century merchant guild house destroyed in World War II and meticulously rebuilt in 1999, is arguably the most photographed building in the Baltics.

## Latvian Food and Drink

Latvian cuisine is hearty, seasonal, and deeply connected to the land. The staples are dark rye bread, smoked fish, pork, potatoes, and dairy — simple ingredients elevated by careful preparation. Pelmenji (dumplings) are the go-to comfort food, and grey peas with smoked bacon is a traditional dish that tastes far better than it sounds. For something more refined, the New Latvian cuisine movement has produced restaurants like Vincents and 3 Pavaru Restorans that reimagine traditional ingredients with contemporary technique.

### Black Balsam Rituals

You cannot visit Riga without confronting Black Balsam. This dark, viscous herbal liqueur has been produced here since 1752, and Latvians treat it with a devotion that borders on the medicinal. The original recipe — 24 botanicals steeped in oak barrels — produces a flavor that is aggressively bitter and oddly addictive. If you find the original too intense, try the blackcurrant version, which softens the blow considerably. The cocktail bars in Old Town serve creative Black Balsam mixed drinks, and Ala Folk Club and Folkklubs Ala Pagrabs are the best places to try them alongside live Latvian folk music.

## Neighborhoods to Explore

### The Quiet Centre (Klusais Centrs)

This residential district east of Old Town is where the Art Nouveau architecture lives, but it is also where you find Riga's best cafes, parks, and a slower pace. Vermanitis Park is a lovely spot for a morning coffee, and the surrounding streets are full of independent shops and bistros. The neighborhood feels like a city within a city — elegant, green, and genuinely livable.

### Moscow District (Maskavas Forstate)

South of the Central Market, Riga's most multicultural neighborhood is rough around the edges but rich in character. The wooden architecture, Orthodox churches, and bargain shops give it a different texture from the polished Old Town. The Spikeri Quarter, a row of renovated 19th-century warehouses along the Daugava River, bridges the gap between gritty and gentrified, with galleries, design shops, and restaurants moving in alongside long-standing businesses.

## Getting Around

Riga's tram, bus, and trolleybus network is efficient and covers the entire city. Buy an electronic e-ticket card from kiosks and load credit onto it — rides cost about €1.15. The Old Town and Art Nouveau district are walkable from each other in about 20 minutes. Bolt operates here for rides to the airport or outer neighborhoods. Riga is also an excellent cycling city, with a flat terrain and expanding bike lane network.

### Scott's Tips for Riga

1. **Walk Alberta and Elizabetes streets in the morning.** The east-facing Art Nouveau facades catch the morning light perfectly, making details pop. By afternoon, they fall into shadow and you lose much of the visual drama.

2. **Eat at the Central Market before noon.** The freshest products sell out early, and the fish pavilion is at its best in the morning. Arrive by 9 AM on a Saturday for the full experience, including the outdoor vendors.

3. **Try the Black Balsam cocktail at Ala Pagrabs.** This underground bar and restaurant doubles as a live music venue and serves the most creative Black Balsam cocktails in the city. The blackcurrant Black Balsam with apple juice on ice is an excellent starter if you are new to the spirit.

4. **Take the free walking tour before exploring solo.** Riga's Old Town has so many layers of history — Teutonic Knights, Hanseatic League, Swedish rule, Russian Empire, Soviet occupation — that a guided introduction helps you make sense of what you are seeing. Free tours depart daily from St. Peter's Church.

5. **Day trip to Jurmala.** This seaside resort town is just 25 minutes by train (€2-3) and has a wide sandy beach, quirky wooden Art Nouveau villas, and a relaxed atmosphere that contrasts nicely with Riga's urban energy. Go on a weekday to avoid the summer weekend crowds.
